# Design Thinking Project – UTM Indoor Navigation System

## Summary
On 17 January 2026, we completed a group design thinking project as part of the TIS course.  
We applied the **design thinking process** to solve real-world problems:  
- **Empathy & Problem Definition:** Understand user needs and challenges  
- **Ideation:** Brainstorm practical solutions  
- **Low-Fidelity Prototype:** Created a video prototype of our proposed solution  

Our project, the **UTM Indoor Navigation System**, helps users navigate indoor spaces effectively by prioritizing **user-centered design**.

## Personal Reflection
This project emphasized the importance of:  
- Collaboration and teamwork  
- Structured problem-solving  
- Designing technology solutions that meet real user needs  

It reinforced that effective tech solutions start with a **clear understanding of the problem and the user**.
